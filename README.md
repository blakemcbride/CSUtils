# CSUtils
C# Utilities

I created these utilities to help me
with a couple of C# projects I had.  Some parts were used in production and were debugged and corrected at that time.
Other parts have not been fully tested.  So, this project is incomplete and not well tested.

This project was a work-in-progress.  I subsequently re-wrote everything in Java.  The Java version
(my Kiss project) is complete and used by developers daily and in several production systems.

This project, at least for now, has been abandoned.
